<h2>Proposal for Green Screen Project</h2>

<p> Working Title: Celestial View
  
For the Green Screen porject I a thinking of creating  a video that transports viewers on a mesmerizing journey through cosmos. Using Adobe Premiere, I will combine space imagery and celestial sounds to create an immersive experience that captures the beauty and majesty of outerspace.

The video will takes viewers on a cosmic voyage through space, showcasing the beauty of distant galaxiesand nebulae. From the serene tranquility of starlit skies to the explosive energy of supernovas, each scene offers a glimpse into the vastness and wonder of the cosmos. By juxtaposing vast expanses of space with microscopic details, I am thinking of creating a sense of scale that emphasizes the enormity of the universe. Viewers will witness the swirling galaxies and star clusters, as well as the delicate lunar landscapes. To enhance the viewing experience, I'm thinking of incoporating immersive sound that evoke the feeling of being in space. Thinking of putting some music that is peaceful to enhance the experience, the audio complements the visual imagery to create a symphony of celestial sounds.This is the idea/proposal I had in mind for the green screen project but not sure if it is too out of reach for a zoom background. </p>
