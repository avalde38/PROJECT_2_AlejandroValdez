<h2>Proposal for Green Screen Project</h2>

<p> Working Title: Celestial Views
  
For the Green Screen project I was thinking of creating  a video that transports viewers on a mesmerizing journey through space. Using Adobe Premiere, I will combine space imagery and celestial sounds/music to create an immersive experience that captures the beauty and majesty of outerspace.

The video will takes viewers on a cosmic voyage through space, showcasing the beauty of distant galaxies and nebulae. From the tranquility of starlit skies to the explosive energy of supernovas, each scene offers a glimpse into the vastness and wonder of the cosmos. By juxtaposing vast expanses of space with microscopic details, I am thinking of creating a sense of scale that emphasizes the enormity of the universe. Being able to see galaxies and star clusters, as well as the delicate lunar landscapes. To enhance the viewing experience, I'm thinking of incoporating immersive sound that evoke the feeling of being in space. Thinking of putting some music that is peaceful to enhance the experience, the audio complements the visual imagery to create a symphony of celestial sounds. This is currently the idea/proposal I had in mind for the green screen project but not sure if it is too out of reach for a zoom background. </p>
